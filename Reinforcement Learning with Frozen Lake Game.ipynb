    "## Abstract\n",
    "   The goal of this assignment is to implement Q-learning using a Q-table. Q-learning is an off policy learning method, which learns from the environment and comes up with a policy, that helps the agent to reach the goal. The first phase of the assignment  gives a baseline implementation of reinforcement learning model , with a clear and step by step implementation of Q learning. The final phase of the report involves an implementation of Q learning using both methods. The environments namely FrozenLake-v0 is generated with the Openaigym, which is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "   Developing a reinforcement learning agent model that automatically learns to play Frozen Lake game and acheive the best possible score over time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Game Introduction\n",
    "   The agent should start from 'S' and move across to reach the frisbee(goal 'G'). While taking steps, there are holes 'H' which lead to end of the game or Frozen ground 'F' which are safe to pass. The agent should choose path intelligently from start 'S' to goal 'G' to gain a reward.\n",

    "### Actions and states in the game\n",
    "   There are 4 actions and 16 states in the game.\n",

    "2. F - frozen (safe, reward = 0)\n",

    "4. G - Goal (reward = 1, terminate the episode)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "### Solution approach\n",
    "   First the agent is trained over 10,000 episodes in which we update the Q-table (containing the action values of the steps taken) using the Bellman's equation and use it as a reference to play the game. The maximum number of steps taken during an episode will remain fixed.<br><br> \n",
    "   The terms in the Bellman's equation are pre-defined which are discounting rate, learning rate and the reward, state, action values are obtained from the environment during the episode based on the action chosen. The Q-table is updated with the result of Bellman's equation.<br><br>\n",
    "   An exploration variable 'epsilon' is also chosen to define the exploration ratio and how it should reduce over time is defined using the exploration equation.<br><br>\n",
    "   Finally the results are evaluated with respect to average steps taken in all the episodes(when the agent plays the game) and the score over time(when agent was trained to play the game).\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Size of Q-table:** (4,16) 4 actions and 16 states.<br>"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Initially the baseline performance is set with certain hyperparameters and the reinforcement learning model is trained using the Q-table. The Q-table is updated using the Bellman's equation by giving weightage to the future reward and prior knowledge.\n",
    "        2. With hyperparameter tuning, the model is improved by changing number of training episodes, alpha(learning rate), gamma(discounting rate), starting epsilon and the decay rate.\n",
    "        3. It has been observed that the model performed poorly with 5000 episodes and later the model showed a bit improved when the alpha and gamma are increased. However, the model required a big number of training episodes to show significant. Hence, a set of 40000 episodes, (learning rate, discounting rate) as (0.85,0.95), starting epsilon as 1.0, decay rate as low as 0.001 resulted in an increased performance of 0.450725 which is an increase of 40% from the baseline performance.\n",
    "        4. Meanwhile, it is also concluded that using different policy functions like meanQ() and minQ() resulted in the decreased performance than the baseline.\n",
    "        3. Later, the model is tested on a 50 episode test-bed and the wins and loses are observed.\n",
    "        4. Finally, the model will result the maximum possible score over time of '0.450725' that it has gained during the Q-learning and plays the game intelligently on it's own."
